          <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is David Westlund. I'm 26 years old and I live and
            study in Jönköping. I was born in Stockholm, but me and my family
            moved up north to a small place called Åre when I was 6 years old.
            Most people know Åre because it's a popular ski resort.

          <h2>WHY NMD?</h2>
          <p>
            I started studying at JU in 2019. But back then I was enrolled in
            the DMP program. I quit DMP last year and started at NMD this fall.
            NMD fits me way better because I like to be creative and see what I
            do. And I also like to code so it's a perfect match!

          <h2>MY HOBBIES</h2>
          <p>
            In my spare time I like to do several things. I've played ice hockey
            since I was about 7 years old, so sometimes I play with JU hockey. I
            really like to watch football. My teams are Djurgården and
            Liverpool. I love movies and going to the cinema. I also make music
            on my computer.
