        <p style="position: absolute; left: 200px; top: 550px">
          Hello! My name is David Westlund. I'm 26 years old and I live and
          study in Jönköping. I was born in Stockholm, but me and my family
          moved up north to a small place called Åre when I was 6 years old.
          Most people know Åre because it's a popular ski resort.

        <p style="position: absolute; left: 780px; top: 550px">
          I started studying at JU in 2019. But back then I was enrolled in the
          DMP program. I quit DMP last year and started at NMD this fall. NMD
          fits me way better because I like to be creative and see what I do.
          And I also like to code so it's a perfect match!

        <p style="position: absolute; right: 200px; top: 550px">
          In my spare time I like to do several things. I've played ice hockey
          since I was about 7 years old, so sometimes I play with JU hockey. I
          really like to watch football. My teams are Djurgården and Liverpool.
          I love movies and going to the cinema. I also make music on my
          computer.
